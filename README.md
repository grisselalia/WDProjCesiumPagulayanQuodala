### Description
This website aims to help Genshin Impact players navigate their way to success in the game. This site will include character information, how to build said characters, tips, tutorials, and the nations of Teyvat. This can act as a helpful guide to starting (or improving) in Genshin if a player finds it hard to understand.

Their pictures will be provided along with basic information such as birthday, occupation, and a description of their personality.

This can include how to unlock the nations and some of the lore regarding them. This will also include bosses and domains part of a particular area. It might also have stated the common monsters seen in said region. 
7. **Sources** - This page will include the sources and websites used in creating the entire project/website.
