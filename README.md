### Description
This website aims to help Genshin Impact players navigate their way to success in the game. This site will include character information, how to build said characters, tips, tutorials, and the nations of Teyvat. This can act as a helpful guide to starting (or improving) in Genshin if a player finds it hard to understand. 

### Webpage Breakdown:
1. **Home Page** - This will serve as the navigation. It will show a short description (along with a picture that encapsulates the information provided) of each webpage and their respective links when you click on the description.

Their pictures will be provided along with basic information such as birthday, occupation, and a description of their personality.
